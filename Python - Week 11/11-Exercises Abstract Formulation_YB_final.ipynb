This means that the math formulation correctly models the given problem and the code outputs the correct results. However, it is okay if the code returns another optimal solution that is equally good. \n",

    "\n",
    "A committee at USC Marshall is exploring the viability of in-person instruction while observing social distancing guidelines. One challenge is that certain classrooms have tables and seats bolted to the floor, and the seats cannot be moved unless the rooms undergo significant remodeling. As an illustration, the following image is a portion of the floor plan for JKP204, and the numbers in the image correspond to the individual seats. As you can see, the distance between adjacent seats can be quite close, and the room would be overly dense if every seat is used. Since the seats cannot be moved, only a subset of them can be used to seat students. "

Based on discussions with public health officials, the committee has summarized the requirements for safely seating students as follows:\n",
