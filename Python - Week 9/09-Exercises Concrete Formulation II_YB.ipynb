However, Finco cannot borrow funds, so net cash on hand must be non-negative in all years. Formulate this as a linear optimization problem."

So using larger boxes might allow the company to make do with fewer box types, which would lower the total fixed cost. For example, using boxes of all three types would incur a fixed cost of 3000, while using only boxes of size 2.0 would incur a fixed cost of 1000. \n",
