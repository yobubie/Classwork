    "- **1 (Some effort)**: Between one third and two thirds of the required questions have a correct solution.\n",
    "- **0 (No submission or essentially blank)**: No submission on Brightspace by the deadline, or less than one third of the required questions have a correct solution.\n",

    "Every question is required unless it is marked with \"(optional)\". **To ensure that you get 3 out of 3, before you submit, restart the Kernel and run all, and check that all of the outputs match the sample outputs from the PDF version of the exercises. You need to develop the habit of meticulously checking your outputs in order to ensure the best grade.** I will not count minor formating, rounding, or importing issues, but otherwise your output should match the sample outputs exactly when rerun.  The weekly exercises are intended to be completed in 4-5 hours, excluding class time. You should budget at least this much time per week for these exercises.\n",

    "## Exercise 4.2: Grocery Store Restocking\n",
    "\n",
    "This question asks you to make a tool that helps a grocery store to analyze their policy for restocking shelves for a certain non-perishable item. Write a function called `analyzeScenario` with three input parameters:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `demandList`: a non-empty list of non-negative integers representing the forecasted daily demand for the item, corresponding to a period of consecutive days. The number of days is `len(demandList)`.\n",
    "- `stockingLevel`: a positive integer representing the maximum number of units that the store will stock on its shelves at any time.\n",
    "- `minimumLevel`: a non-negative integer representing the minimum number of units on the shelves that the store can tolerate without restocking. \n",
    "\n",
    "Assume that the store makes its stocking decision at the end of each day after closing. If the leftover inventory on the shelf at the end of a day is strictly below the \"minimumLevel\", then the store will restock to a full shelf, and the inventory at the beginning of the next day will be equal to \"stockingLevel\". If the leftover inventory at the end of a day is greater than or equal to \"minimumLevel\", then the store will not add anything to the shelf, and the inventory at the beginning of the next day will be the same as the leftover inventory. On the first day, the shelf is full, so the inventory level is equal to \"stockingLevel\".\n",
    "\n",
    "Your function should print (not return) the number of times it would decide to restock during the period represented by the input data. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, the sample run\n",
    "```python\n",
    "analyzeScenario([3,4,2,5,15,3,9,3,1,3,9],10,3)\n",
    "```\n",
    "should result in exactly the following message printed to screen.\n",
    "```\n",
    "The store needs to restock 4 times.\n",
    "```\n",
    "The following table illustrates the inventory dynamics.\n",
    "\n",
    "| Beginning Inventory | Demand |   Leftover Inventory | Restock? |\n",
    "|--|--|--|--|\n",
    "|10|3 |7 |No |\n",
    "|7 |4 |3 |No |\n",
    "|3 |2 |1 | Yes |\n",
    "|10|5 |5 | No |\n",
    "| 5|15|0 |Yes |\n",

    "|3 | 9 |  0 | Yes |\n",
    "|**# of times to restock:**|` `|` `| **4**|\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that if demand is greater than the beginning inventory, the leftover inventory is zero. Otherwise, the leftover inventory is equal to the beginning inventory minus the demand. The final answer (the number of times to restock) is equal to the number of Yes's in the last column of the table.\n",

    "In the above table, the first column correspond to the positions of the list. The second column is the corresponding value in the list `forecast`. The last column is 0 whenever the current day is wet, and increments by 1 whenever the current day is dry. The desired \"maxDryPeriod\" is the maximum entry in the last column, and the desired \"startDay\" is equal to `t-maxDryPeriod+1` where `t` is the first \"Day\" in which the last column attains the value \"maxDryPeriod\". In the above example, \"maxDryPeriod\" is 4 and \"t\" is 5, so \"startPosition\" is 2."
