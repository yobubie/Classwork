    "## Exercise 12.1: Optimizing Studying Time\n",
    "\n",
    "Dominique is applying what he learned about optimization to improve his time usage while studying for final exams. He has created a table listing the various topics to study for, his current estimated level of mastery of each topic, the difficulty of the topic as measured by the number of hours studying needed for him to gain an additional level of mastery, and the importance of sufficiently mastering the topic for his future career. For each topic, a level of mastery of 5 is the threshold for \"sufficient mastery,\"  and although it is possible to achieve beyond level 5, it is not necessary for him at this point. The two desirable outcomes Dominique would like to achieve are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Attaining level 5 mastery for all topics as much as he can, especially for the most important topics.\n",
    "2. Not spending too much time in total, so as to maintain a sane work-life balance and fulfill other responsibilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "To achieve these goals, he has formulated the following optimization problem. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Data:** \n",
    "\n",
    "- $T$: set of topics.\n",
    "- $c_t$: current level of mastery for topic $t \\in T$ before studying for finals. \n",
    "- $d_t$: difficulty of topic $t$ as measured by the number of hours needed to gain each additional level of mastery.\n",
    "- $w_t$: importance of achieving at least level 5 mastery for his future career.\n",
    "- $B$: budget of time he would like to allocate in terms of the total hours of studying for these topics.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Decision Variables:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- $x_t$: number of hours to study for topic $t \\in T$. (Continuous)\n",
    "- $g_t$: auxiliary decision variable for each topic $t\\in T$ representing the gap between his level of mastery after studying and the target mastery level of $5$. (Continuous) \n",
    "\n",
    "**Objective and Constraints:**\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\begin{aligned}\n",
    "\\text{Minimize} && \\sum_{t \\in T} w_t g_t^2 \\\\\n",
    "\\text{s.t.}  \\\\\n",

    "&& g_t & \\ge 5- c_t - \\frac{x_t}{d_t} && \\text{for each topic $t \\in T$.}\\\\\n",
    "&& x_t,g_t & \\ge 0 && \\text{for each topic $t \\in T$.}\n",
    "\\end{aligned}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that this is a non-linear formulation because the objective involves the square of the decision variable $g_t$. To implement this, simply do $g_t*g_t$ in the Gurobi code. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Write a function called \"optimizeTime\" with two input parameters:**\n",

    "- **inputFile**: filename of a CSV file providing the data on the various topics. You may assume that the column headers of the input file are exactly as in the attached file \"12-time-input.csv\". The four columns correspond exactly to the first four data variables listed in the formulation.\n",
    "- **B**: a positive number giving the value of the data variable $B$. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Your function should return a Pandas Series in which the index denotes the topic names and the value the optimal number of hours to study for that topic. Only topics with studying time at least 0.01 hours should be included.** The topic names (for the index) are given as the first column of the inputFile, and the optimal number of hours of studying for topic $t$ is given by $x_t$.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the test run, you should download the input file attached to this exercise into the same directory as the Jupyter notebook. Below is what this file looks like."

    "## Problem Description\n",
    "\n",
    "Imani is in charge of scheduling shifts for all nurses at the emergency department at Trojan hospital. **In order to retain quality staff, the hospital would like to create schedules that satisfy their preferences as much as possible, while respecting operational constraints and treating nurses fairly.** In the past, she created schedules by hand, which is very time consuming and she was never sure whether she has found the best schedule. Recently, after learning about linear optimization modeling, she would like to apply her knowledge to create an optimization tool that can be used to automatically generate the best schedule.\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on her experience, she has created a template input file to store all of the relevant input data. See the `12-scheduling-input-1.xlsx` file for a smaller file for development purposes. The file contains 9 nurses and 1 week. See the `12-scheduling-input-2.xlsx` for a larger file containing a realistic instance, with 50 nurses and 9 weeks.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Ideally, a schedule should maximize the total preference scores of nurses**. The preference scores are specified in the input data in the sheet called \"Preferences\". For each shift, a nurse may indicate a preference score of 0, 1, or 2. A score of 0 indicates that the nurse is unavailable to work that shift. A score of 1 indicates that the time is not preferred, but the nurse is willing to work if needed. A score of 2 indicates a preferred time slot. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Operational constraints:** \n",
    "\n",
    "- There are three nurse shifts in a day: morning, evening, and nights. Each shift should have exactly a certain number of nurses, which is specified in the input file in the sheet called \"Requirements\". You may assume that Shift 0 corresponds to a morning shift, shift 1 to an evening shift, shift 2 to a night shift, shift 3 to a morning shift, etc. Moreover you may assume that the total number of shifts is a multiple of 3.\n",
    "- If a nurse works in a night shift, he/she must take the two prior shifts off as well as the two next shifts off. For example, if a nurse works on Shift 2, then she must not work in shifts 0, 1, 3, and 4. If a nurse works on Shift 5, then she must not work in shifts 3, 4, 6, and 7. This ensures that nurses get proper rest.\n",
    "- No nurse may be scheduled to consecutive shifts. However, it is possible for example to work both shifts 1 and 3, as they are not consecutive and neither is a night shift.\n",
    "- If a nurse indicates that he/she is unavailable to work in a given shift (i.e. preference score of 0 for a shift), then the nurse cannot be assigned to that shift.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Fairness constraint:** The total number of shifts assigned to a nurse must be similar across nurses. Precisely speaking, there is a certain inequality $k$, and the total number of shifts worked by any given nurse must be within $k$ of each other. For example, if $k=2$, then the constraint would be violated if Alice is assigned 10 shifts and Bob is assigned 7 shifts. But it would not be violated if every nurse is assigned between 8 and 10 shifts (inclusive). \n",
    "\n",
    "**Write a function called `computeSchedule` with three input parameters:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **inputFile**: an Excel file of the same format as the `12-scheduling-input-1.xlsx` and `12-scheduling-input-2.xlsx` files.\n",
    "- **k**: the inequality parameter in the fairness constraint. \n",
    "- **outputFile**: an output file generated by the function which contains an optimal schedule in one sheet. In the other sheet, the file contains the optimal objective value, the value of k, as well as the optimal objective value divided by the total number of shifts assigned, which can be interpreted as the average preference score for an assigned shift.  For sample outputs, see the `12-scheduling-sampleOutput-1.xlsx` and `12-scheduling-sampleOutput-2.xlsx` files attached on Blackboard. Note that there may be multiple optimal schedules, so your code may output a different schedule for the same value of k, but the optimal objective value must be the same.\n"

    "Nia is a data analyst at Trojan E-commerce, a medium sized online retailer with 17 fulfilment centers scattered across the US. She would like to apply optimization to minimize the weekly outbound shipping cost from fulfilment centers to customers. Trojan uses UPS 2-day delivery. Based on a regression analysis, she found that the cost of shipping each unit of item $k$ from fulfillment center (FC) $i$ to demand region $j$ is $1.38 w_k \\delta_{ij}$, where $w_k$ is the shipping weight of the item and $\\delta_{ij}$ is the distance from FC $i$ to region $j$. \n",

    "Trojan is committed to satisfying all customer demand for all of the items at all demand regions. The weekly demand for item $k$ in region $j$ is given as $d_{jk}$. However, Trojan can choose how much of this to provide from each FC. Using a closer FC would reduce the shipping cost, but capacity at each FC is limited. (For simplicity, assume that fractional amounts of items is allowed, so the amount shipped does not have to be an integer.) The company replenishes inventory every week. At any given FC, the amount of capacity required for processing each unit of item $k$ is equal to $s_k$. The total capacity of FC $i$ is given as $q_i$.\n",
